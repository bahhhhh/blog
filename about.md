I forget… everything. So I’m using this blog as a dumping ground for things I’ve worked on in my professional life.

I’ve worked as a Mac and Windows admin for a few years, but now I’m doing more Linux-y things. Therefore, you’ll likely be seeing more Linux related posts going forward. Maybe not though...
